# Startpage-2
The idea of this project is to create an expandable startpage for my broswser.
There were multiple requirements for this startpage going in:
* It must be modular, that is having categories that expand into lists of commonly used links
* It must contain a google search feature
* It must look good

The theme chosen for the startpage (Being purely a personal project) was a pixel-art cityscape with nice warm oranges and purples.
The design uses a horizontal bar to contain the categories, which each dropdown into subcategories for easy access.
There was a clock feature on the top right added for utility.
The rightmost item on the navbar is a searchbar that can be used to google search terms.

In all the project is a success and can be expanded easily with HTML with more links or categories as they are needed.
